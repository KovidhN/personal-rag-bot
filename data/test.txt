I am a BTech student specializing in Artificial Intelligence and Data Science.

I have worked on multiple machine learning projects involving data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

My NLP-related work includes text preprocessing, vector embeddings, and building a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system using FAISS and a local language model.

I have hands-on experience with Python, data analytics, and building end-to-end ML pipelines.

I have also held leadership roles, including serving as deputy head boy, where I managed teams and coordinated activities.
